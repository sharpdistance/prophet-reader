The Prophet Reader
An offline Android-based reader for the poetry of "The Prophet" by Kahlil Gibran

Thanks for reading this! The Prophet Reader is my very first Android app.

Above my own success, I want to ensure that those who helped me to develop this app are properly credited and honored:
I built The Prophet Reader using scraps of code from Michael Shick's bus schedule app "Alexandriabus". 
Please visit Mike's webpage here: https://shick.xyz/
And if you're curious, here's the Alexandriabus repo: https://fossil.shick.xyz/alexandriabus/home
